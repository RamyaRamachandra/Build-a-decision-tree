    "A decision tree model can makes predictions for a target based on\n",
    "multiple features. Because decision trees are used across a wide array\n",
    "of industries, becoming proficient in the process of building one will\n",
    "help you expand your skill set in a widely-applicable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this activity, you work as a consultant for an airline. The airline\n",
    "is interested in predicting whether a future customer would be satisfied\n",
    "with their services given previous customer feedback about their flight\n",
    "experience. The airline would like you to construct and evaluate a model\n",
    "that can accomplish this goal. Specifically, they are interested in\n",
    "knowing which features are most important to customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this activity includes survey responses from 129,880\n",
    "customers. It includes data points such as class, flight distance, and\n",
    "in-flight entertainment, among others. In a previous activity, you\n",
    "utilized a binomial logistic regression model to help the airline better\n",
    "understand this data. In this activity, your goal will be to utilize a\n",
    "decision tree model to predict whether or not a customer will be\n",
    "satisfied with their flight experience.\n",
